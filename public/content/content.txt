our story
Appatex was formally established in 2010, but our story began long before. Our founders, Mr. Shaikh Ziaul Islam and Mr. Muhammad Abu Kaisarul Alam, have been deeply embedded in the textile industry for decades.
Appatex is the culmination of a rich journey of learning and growth through previous ventures like Rupsa International, Rupsa Apparel, Whitetex, and Manville International. 
This extensive background has provided us with an unparalleled depth of knowledge in manufacturing, quality control, and international supply chain management, all of which we now channel into Appatex for our clients' benefit.
